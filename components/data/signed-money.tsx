/**
 * An amount, coloured by its sign.
 *
 * Green and red are for the *unexpected*, not for good and bad. Every balance
 * here is shown on its account's natural side, so a positive figure is an
 * account behaving as its type says it should and a negative one is a contra
 * position — a bank account overdrawn, an expense account in credit, a customer
 * with a credit balance. Those are the ones worth finding on a page of numbers.
 *
 * Zero stays plain. A page where every row is coloured is a page where the
 * colour has stopped meaning anything.
