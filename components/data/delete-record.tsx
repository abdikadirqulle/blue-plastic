/**
 * Deleting a record, wherever it lives.
 *
 * **One verb.** Delete. There is no Void here, no Reverse, no "close instead",
 * and no branching on what the record happens to be — the person clicked Delete
 * and the record goes. Whatever has to happen underneath to make that safe (the
 * journal withdrawn, stock put back, payments released, a purchase order's count
 * restored) happens in the service, and is not the user's problem or the user's
 * vocabulary. `server/accounting/deletion.ts` explains the mechanism.
 *
 * Two shapes, because a list and a record page are different rooms.
 * `DeleteButton` is the control on the record's own page; `DeleteMenuItem` is the
 * same thing at the end of a row menu. Both open the same dialog, which names the
 * record and takes an optional reason.
