 * income on the accrual basis and nothing at all on the cash basis.
 *
 * This is a real cash basis, not a filter on document type: it asks whether the
 * journal touched money, which is the question the cash basis actually asks.
 *
 * `excludeClosing` leaves out the year-end closing entry.
 *
 * A closing entry takes every income and expense account to zero at the year end.
 * It is a bookkeeping mechanism, not trading, and a profit and loss that counted
 * it would report the closed year as having earned nothing — which would make
 * every comparative against a closed year useless. So the profit and loss and the
 * cash flow leave it out; the balance sheet, trial balance and general ledger keep
 * it, because there the transfer to Retained Earnings is a real movement.
 *
 * Leaving it out is safe for the cash flow's identity: a closing entry balances
 * and touches no cash account, so removing it from every account at once changes
 * neither Σ(debit − credit) = 0 nor the movement in cash.
