/**
 * Deleting a transaction, once, for the whole system.
 *
 * **What "delete" means here.** The record is marked deleted and disappears —
 * from every list, every selector, every search, every report and every balance.
 * As far as the application is concerned it is gone, and that is what the person
 * who clicked Delete asked for and what they get.
 *
 * **What it does not mean.** The row is not removed from PostgreSQL, and neither
 * is its journal, its lines, or the stock it moved. Nothing is edited: no amount
 * changes, no line is rewritten, no running total is recomputed. A posted entry
 * stays exactly as it was posted, for ever.
 *
 * Those two things are compatible because balances in this system are *derived*.
 * There is no stored balance to correct and no rebuild to run (see
 * `server/accounting/balances.ts`); every figure is an aggregate over journal
 * lines, and every one of those aggregates now excludes `DELETED` journals. So
 * marking the journal is sufficient — the money leaves the reports the moment the
 * status changes, and it leaves them everywhere at once, because there is one
 * definition of which journals count rather than one per report.
 *
 * Keeping the row is not sentimentality. It is the difference between "this
 * invoice never existed" and "this invoice was entered on the 3rd and withdrawn
 * on the 9th by Amina" — and the second is the one an auditor, or the owner in
 * six months, actually needs. The immutability triggers are untouched: R4 still
 * refuses every UPDATE to a posted journal except this one, and refuses it unless
 * the deletion stamp is set in the same statement.
 *
 * **Not exposed as anything else.** There is no Void, no Reverse and no
 * alternative workflow in front of the person. One verb.

 * leaving a reversal behind after its original was withdrawn would post the
 * mirror of an entry that no longer counts, which is exactly backwards. And the
 * stock movements the journal carried are detached from the active ledger by the
 * same act: they are found through the journal, and the stock queries exclude
 * deleted journals, so no movement row has to be touched.
 *
 * Idempotent. Deleting something already deleted changes nothing and does not
 * fail, because two people clicking Delete on the same row is ordinary.
