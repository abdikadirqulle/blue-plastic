-- Master data integrity  (Phase 3)

-- Same principle as the ledger rules: the services check first because they can

-- R9 (continued) -- Subledger dimensions cannot cross organisations.

-- Phase 2 created journal_lines."customerId" / "vendorId" without foreign keys,
-- because the tables did not exist yet. They do now. As with the journal and
-- account references, these carry "orgId" into the key so a line can never point
-- at another organisation's customer or vendor.
