-- Period close and year-end integrity  (Phase 9)
--
-- R5/R6 already stop a posting entering a closed period; those live in
-- ledger-integrity.sql. What follows protects the *close itself*: the record of
-- which journal closed which year, and the consistency of a year's own state.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


-- R9 -- A year's closing journal belongs to the same organisation.
--
-- Without this the closingJournalId is an ordinary foreign key that would happily
-- point at another tenant's journal, and reopening the year would reverse it.

-- A journal that says it is a closing entry is sourced as one, or reverses one.
--
-- The flag and the source type are two records of the same fact, and the reports
-- read one while the year-end reads the other. Letting them disagree would mean
-- a closing entry invisible to the adjusting-entries report, or an ordinary
-- journal counted as a year-end.
--
-- REVERSAL is allowed because reopening a year reverses its closing entry, and
-- that reversal has to carry the flag: the profit and loss leaves closing entries
-- out, and if it left out the sweep but counted the sweep coming back, a reopened
-- year would report double its income.

-- or would orphan the first closing entry.
