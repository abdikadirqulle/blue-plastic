# 04 — Development Roadmap

Nine phases. Each is shippable on its own and leaves the system in a correct state;
none is a "big bang" that only works once the next one lands.

The ordering is driven by one constraint: **the ledger must be correct before
anything writes to it.** Sales, purchases and banking are all just document types
that produce journals, so they cannot be built before the engine that accepts those
journals exists. Everything after Phase 2 is, structurally, the same work repeated
with different debits and credits.

P7 (Inventory) depends on P3 for items and on P4/P5 for the documents that move
stock, but its *engine* only needs P2. It is scheduled after P5 so that both the
buy side and the sell side exist to move stock in and out.

P8 (Reporting) needs only P2 for the statement trio (TB, P&L, BS); the sales and
purchase reports arrive with their phases. It is scheduled late so that reports are
written once against a full ledger rather than three times against a growing one.

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Identity

**Goal:** a secure, fast, multi-tenant-ready application shell that anything can be
built inside, with the primitives every later phase depends on.

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 1.1 | Next.js 16 + TypeScript strict + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui, path aliases, ESLint layering rules |
| 1.2 | Prisma + PostgreSQL wiring, connection singleton, `.env.example`, db scripts |
| 1.3 | Foundation schema: `Organization`, `User`, `Membership`, NextAuth tables, `AuditLog`, `DocumentSequence` |
| 1.4 | NextAuth v5: credentials provider, JWT with `orgId`/`role`/`membershipVersion`, edge-safe middleware split |
| 1.5 | RBAC: `Role`/`Permission` model, permission matrix, `requireOrgContext(permission)` |
| 1.6 | `OrgContext` plumbing and tenant-scoping guarantees |
| 1.7 | Money (`Decimal`) and calendar-date primitives + formatting |
| 1.8 | Error model (`AppError`), `ActionResult`, server-action wrapper, route-handler envelope |
| 1.9 | Audit log service (write-through, inside caller's transaction) |
| 1.10 | Document numbering service with row-lock allocation |
| 1.11 | App shell: sidebar, topbar, user menu, theme, responsive layout, loading/error/empty states |
| 1.12 | Auth screens: sign in, first-run setup (create organisation + owner), sign out |
| 1.13 | Settings: organisation profile, fiscal year & currency; users & roles management |
| 1.14 | TanStack Query provider + typed API-fetch helper |
| 1.15 | Vitest setup; unit tests for money, dates, permissions, sequences; integration test for tenant isolation |
| 1.16 | Seed script: organisation + owner user |

**Exit criteria:** a user can sign in, land on an app shell, see their organisation
settings, invite and role-manage users; `pnpm verify` (lint + typecheck + test)
passes; cross-tenant access is proven impossible by test.

**Explicitly not in Phase 1:** any accounting concept. No accounts, no journals, no
money movement. Mixing shell work with ledger work is how ledger work gets rushed.

---

## Phase 2 — Accounting Core

**Goal:** the double-entry engine, and nothing that isn't.

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 2.1 | `LedgerAccount` schema, types/subtypes, hierarchy, `systemKey` |
| 2.2 | `FiscalYear` / `AccountingPeriod` schema + generation for a year |
| 2.3 | `Journal` / `JournalLine` schema |
| 2.4 | All integrity triggers R1–R10 as raw SQL migrations + `db:verify` |
| 2.5 | Posting engine `postJournal` / `reverseJournal` |
| 2.6 | Chart-of-accounts seeder (default CoA for a goods-trading business) + system accounts |
| 2.7 | Chart of accounts UI: tree, create/edit/deactivate, merge guard |
| 2.8 | Manual journal entry UI with live debit/credit balancing |
| 2.9 | Opening balances workflow via Opening Balance Equity |
| 2.10 | Trial balance + general ledger + account register (drill-down) |
| 2.11 | Period open/close UI and guard |
| 2.12 | Test suite: every integrity rule, reversal semantics, period guard, balanced-posting property tests |

**Exit criteria:** a manual journal can be posted, reversed and inspected; an
unbalanced journal is impossible from the API *and* from psql; the trial balance
nets to zero.

---

## Phase 3 — Master Data & Tax

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 3.1 | Customers (billing/shipping address, terms, opening balance, credit limit) |
| 3.2 | Vendors (terms, tax id, opening balance, default expense account) |
| 3.3 | Items: service, non-inventory, inventory — with account mappings |
| 3.4 | Tax agencies, tax codes, tax rates, compound and inclusive/exclusive handling |
| 3.5 | Payment terms and due-date calculation |
| 3.6 | Shared list UX: search, filter, pagination, bulk activate/deactivate, CSV import |
| 3.7 | Opening balance posting for customers/vendors through AR/AP + OBE |

**Exit criteria:** master data exists with correct account mappings and a customer
opening balance lands in AR and on the aging report.

---

## Phase 4 — Sales / Accounts Receivable

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 4.1 | Invoice document + lines, totals, tax, terms, due date |
| 4.2 | Invoice posting builder + edit-as-reverse-and-repost |
| 4.3 | Estimates and estimate → invoice conversion |
| 4.4 | Sales receipts (cash sales) |
| 4.5 | Customer payments with application to invoices, partial and over-payment |
| 4.6 | Credit memos and their application |
| 4.7 | Refund receipts |
| 4.8 | AR aging, customer statement, customer transaction list |
| 4.9 | Document numbering, PDF/print view, email-ready layout |
| 4.10 | Void/delete semantics |

---

## Phase 5 — Purchases / Accounts Payable

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 5.1 | Bills + lines (expense, item, fixed asset) |
| 5.2 | Bill posting builder |
| 5.3 | Expenses (immediate cash/card purchases) |
| 5.4 | Vendor credits and application |
| 5.5 | Bill payments with application, partial payment, batch pay |
| 5.6 | Purchase orders and PO → bill conversion |
| 5.7 | AP aging, vendor transaction list, unpaid bills |

---

## Phase 6 — Banking & Cash

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | Bank & credit-card account registers with running balance |
| 6.2 | Transfers between accounts |
| 6.3 | Deposits, including clearing Undeposited Funds |
| 6.4 | Bank statement import (CSV/OFX) into a staging table |
| 6.5 | Matching engine: suggest matches to existing documents |
| 6.6 | Reconciliation workflow: statement balance, cleared items, difference must be zero, lock on finish |
| 6.7 | Reconciliation report and undo-reconciliation with audit |

---

## Phase 7 — Inventory

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 7.1 | `InventoryTransaction` ledger + weighted-average cost engine |
| 7.2 | COGS posting integrated into invoice / sales receipt / credit memo |
| 7.3 | Receipt of stock through bills and purchase orders |
| 7.4 | Inventory adjustments (quantity and value) |
| 7.5 | Negative-stock policy and cost true-up |
| 7.6 | Stock on hand, inventory valuation summary/detail, reorder report |
| 7.7 | Reconciliation test: inventory ledger value == Inventory Asset GL balance |

---

## Phase 8 — Financial Reporting

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 8.1 | Report framework: date ranges, comparison periods, accrual/cash basis, drill-down |
| 8.2 | Profit & Loss (% of income, comparative period) — monthly columns dropped, the comparative answers the question |
| 8.3 | Balance Sheet (with self-check assertion) |
| 8.4 | Statement of Cash Flows (indirect) |
| 8.5 | Trial balance, general ledger detail, journal report — delivered in Phases 2 and 4–5 |
| 8.6 | Sales by customer/item, purchases by vendor, expenses by category |
| 8.7 | Tax summary, split rate by rate for filing |
| 8.8 | ~~`account_period_balances` rollup~~ — not built; measured and declined in [ADR-0010](./decisions/0010-no-balance-rollup-table.md) |
| 8.9 | CSV export; report settings carried in the URL. PDF dropped — the browser already prints one |
| 8.10 | Dashboard: cash position, income vs expense, AR/AP aging summary, recent activity |

---

## Phase 9 — Period Close & Year-End

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 9.1 | Adjusting journal entries flagged and reportable separately |
| 9.2 | Month-end close checklist (unreconciled items, unapplied payments, out-of-balance checks) |
| 9.3 | Year-end closing entry to Retained Earnings, reversible |
| 9.4 | Period lock/unlock with audit and permission gate — delivered in Phase 2, extended here with the year lock |
| 9.5 | Prior-period comparatives after close — [ADR-0011](./decisions/0011-closing-entries-excluded-from-the-profit-and-loss.md) |

---

## Phase 10 — Interface & Hardening

Re-scoped by the owner on 2026-08-29 towards the interface, which is where the
remaining cost was: the accounting has been right since Phase 2.

| # | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 10.1 | Sidebar reduced to modules; related screens become tabs inside each module |
| 10.2 | Searchable comboboxes for every record picker, with inline create where it is safe |
| 10.3 | One dialog primitive and one select primitive; retire the hand-rolled duplicates |
| 10.4 | Navigation progress indicator |
| 10.5 | Frontend performance pass — fewer client components, no unused libraries in the first load |
| 10.6 | Command palette and keyboard shortcuts for common actions |
| 10.7 | Help and system guidance inside the application, in place of a separate manual |
| 10.8 | Quick Create — one button that starts any document or record |
| 10.9 | Calendar date picker in place of the browser's date input |

Carried forward, unbuilt: attachments on documents, full-text search, rate
limiting, backup/restore runbook, multi-currency activation, and an end-to-end
browser test suite covering a full accounting cycle from opening balances to
year-end close.
