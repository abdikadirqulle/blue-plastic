## Hard rules for anyone (human or AI) working in this repo

1. **Nothing writes to the general ledger except the posting engine**
   (`src/server/accounting/posting.ts`). No service, no route, no script.
2. **Posted journals are immutable.** Corrections are reversals, never edits.
   Database triggers enforce this — application code is the second line of defence.
3. **Every query is organisation-scoped.** `orgId` comes from the session, never
   from the request body.
4. **Money is `NUMERIC(19,4)`.** Never a JavaScript `number`. Never a float.
5. One phase at a time. Do not start the next phase without explicit instruction.
